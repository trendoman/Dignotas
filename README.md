# Dignotas

### I aim to be thanksworthy and thankful.

I'll read again your kind words, People of Earth, whenever I need to feel better.

I will always remember the good times by re-publishing here what's been said publicly to me. *Mmm..., only good things!*

&mdash; Antony

A very useful thing to get quick answers for many questions. In some cases, much faster than forum. Especially when it is difficult to formulate. Anton generously shares his experience with Couch. :D And of course the live chat is really live!

A big thanks to trendoman for his great help via skype. <br>
By the way this is Unofficial help - given generously by a CouchCMS user. trendoman is NOT the developer - so be pleasant when you chat with him :-)
